            /* LINEAR SCALES

            A linear scale maps a CONTINUOUS domain of values
            to a CONTINUOUS range of values.

            The pattern for constructing a linear scale is:

            d3.scaleLinear()
                .domain([DOMAIN_MIN, DOMAIN_MAX])
                .range([RANGE_MIN, RANGE_MAX]);

            In the domain, `DOMAIN_MIN` and `DOMAIN_MAX`
            are the smallest and largest values in the original
            variable being mapped, respectively. These min
            and max values are supplied as an array of values.

            In the range, `RANGE_MIN` and `RANGE_MAX`
            are the smallest and largest values that the values
            in the domain are being mapped to.

            d3.scaleLinear() creates a function for us.

            When we pass `DOMAIN_MIN` into the function, it will
            return to us the value `RANGE_MIN`.

            When we pass `DOMAIN_MAX` into the function, it will
            return to us the value `RANGE_MAX`.

            If we pass any other value in between `DOMAIN_MIN` and
            `DOMAIN_MAX`, we will get the corresponding value
            in between `RANGE_MIN` and `RANGE_MAX`.


            EXPERIMENTS TO TEST:
            What happens if you lengthen the domain?
            What happens if you shorten the range?

            */

            let linear = d3.scaleLinear()
                .domain([0, 100])
                .range([0, 1000]);

            let min = `When we pass the value 0 into the linear scale, we get the value ${linear(0)} back`;
            let midpoint = `When we pass the value 50 into the linear scale, we get the value ${linear(50)} back`;
            let max = `When we pass the value 100 into the linear scale, we get the value ${linear(100)} back`;
            console.log(min);
            console.log(midpoint);
            console.log(max);



            
            /* BAND SCALES

            A band scale maps a DISCRETE domain of values
            to a CONTINUOUS range of values.

            The pattern for constructing a band scale is:

            d3.scaleBand()
                .domain([A, B, C, D, ...])
                .range([RANGE_MIN, RANGE_MAX]);

            In the domain, the values A, B, C, D, etc. are discrete
            values of a variable that we want to map to a continuous
            output range. We supply the discrete values as an array.

            In the range, `RANGE_MIN` and `RANGE_MAX`
            are the smallest and largest values that the values
            in the domain are being mapped to.

            d3.scaleBand() creates a function for us.

            The distance defined by .range() is divided into
            equal segments of equal length.

            The number of segments is determined by the number
            of values in the .domain().

            When we pass the FIRST value in .domain() into the function,
            we get back the position of the FIRST segment in .range().

            When we pass the SECOND value in .domain() into the function,
            we get back the position of the SECOND segment in .range().

            The rest of the segments follow suit.


            EXPERIMENTS TO TEST:

            What happens if you add more values to the array of the domain?
            What happens if you change the minimum and maximum values
            of the range?
            What happens if you pass in a value that isn't in the domain?

            */


            let band = d3.scaleBand()
                .domain(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'])
                .range([0, 100]);

            min = `When we pass the value 'A' into the band scale, we get the value ${band('A')} back`;
            midpoint = `When we pass the value 'C' into the band scale, we get the value ${band('E')} back`;

            /* ORDINAL SCALES

            An ordinal scale maps a DISCRETE domain of values
            to a DISCRETE range of values.

            The pattern for constructing an ordinal scale is:

            d3.scaleOrdinal()
                .domain([A1, B1, C1, D1, ...])
                .range([A2, B2, C2, D2, ...]);

            In the domain, the values A1, B1, C1, D1, etc. are discrete
            values of a variable that we want to map to a discrete
            output range. We supply the discrete values as an array.

            In the range, the values A2, B2, C2, D3, etc. are discrete
            values that the values in the domain are being mapped to.
            We supply the discrete values as an array.

            The number is values in the domain must equal the number
            of values in the range.

            d3.scaleOrdinal() creates a function for us.

            Each value in the domain is mapped to the corresponding
            value in the range, in the order of position.

            When we pass the FIRST value in .domain() into the function,
            we get back the FIRST value in .range().

            When we pass the SECOND value in .domain() into the function,
            we get back the SECOND value in .range().

            The rest of the segments follow suit.


            EXPERIMENTS TO TEST:

            What happens if you add more values to the array of the domain?
            What happens if you change the order of values in the range?
            What happens if you remove a value from the domain?
                * Remove 'E' from the domain; why does 'E' still get mapped to 'epsilon'?
                * Don't change the values of the domain or range, but pass in a
                different value that's not in the domain, e.g., ordinal('Q'). 
                What value do you get back?

            */


            let ordinal = d3.scaleOrdinal()
                .domain(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'])
                .range(['alpha', 'beta', 'gamma', 'delta', 'epsilon']);

            min = `When we pass the value 'A' into the ordinal scale, we get the value ${ordinal('A')} back`;
            midpoint = `When we pass the value 'C' into the ordinal scale, we get the value ${ordinal('C')} back`;
            max = `When we pass the value 'E' into the ordinal scale, we get the value ${ordinal('E')} back`;

            /* SQUARE ROOT SCALES

            y = mâˆšx + b

            A square root scale maps a CONTINUOUS domain of values
            to a CONTINUOUS range of values.

            The pattern for constructing a square root scale is:

            d3.scaleSqrt()
                .domain([DOMAIN_MIN, DOMAIN_MAX])
                .range([RANGE_MIN, RANGE_MAX]);

            A square root scale is the same as a linear scale, but
            with one key difference: each value in the range is
            proportional to the *square root* of the corresponding
            value in the domain.

            (Can you imagine a scenario when this might be useful?)

            d3.scaleSqrt() creates a function for us.

            When we pass `DOMAIN_MIN` into the function, it will
            return to us the value `RANGE_MIN`.

            When we pass `DOMAIN_MAX` into the function, it will
            return to us the value `RANGE_MAX`.

            If we pass any other value in between `DOMAIN_MIN` and
            `DOMAIN_MAX`, we will get the corresponding value
            in between `RANGE_MIN` and `RANGE_MAX`.


            EXPERIMENTS TO TEST:

            Consider the following scale, which has the same domain
            and range as the square root scale, but using a linear scale:

            let s1 = d3.scaleLinear()
                .domain([0, 10])
                .range([0, 100]);

            Compare the values returned by sqrt(5) and s1(5). How are the two
            values related to one another?

            What happens if you multiply the result of the square root scale
            by itself, e.g., sqrt(5)*sqrt(5)?

            */


            let sqrt = d3.scaleSqrt()
                .domain([0, 10])
                .range([0, 100]);

            min = `When we pass the value 0 into the square root scale, we get the value ${sqrt(0)} back`;
            midpoint = `When we pass the value 5 into the square root scale, we get the value ${sqrt(5)} back`;
            max = `When we pass the value 10 into the square root scale, we get the value ${sqrt(10)} back`;
            console.log(min);
            console.log(midpoint);
            console.log(max);
