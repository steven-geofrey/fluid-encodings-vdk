# About these demonstrations

This folder contains larger demonstrations of various types of visualizations, both static and interactive. Each demonstration is provided as a folder with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and data files.

**To run most of these demonstrations, an HTTP server is required.** This is because most of the demonstrations load data from an external file, e.g., CSV. If you use Visual Studio Code, the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) will run a simple HTTP server for you to run the demonstration. Other techniques will also work, such as using Python's `http.server`.
