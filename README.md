# About the Fluid Encodings VDK

This repository holds demonstrations and templates for a variety of visualizations (e.g., scatter plot, geographic map) and visualization-related strategies (e.g., drawing text along a path in SVG and HTML Canvas, drawing random ribbon structures), loosely collected together as the *Fluid Encodings VDK*, or *visualization development kit*. These demonstrations were written by Steven Geofrey and used in courses taught by Steven at Northeastern University (Boston, MA), namely Visualization Technologies 1: Fundamentals and Visualization Technologies 2: Advanced Practices.

The primary technologies used in these demonstrations are JavaScript, D3.js, and HTML Canvas for drawing with data, and CSS and HTML for web design.

# Organization

In this repository, demonstrations are organized based on their type and purpose:
* **Visualization Templates**: Includes complete code files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and data files) for drawing a variety of visualization types using D3. Examples include simple and interactive scatter plots, bar charts, geographic maps, and hierarchical visualizations (circle packing, treemaps, force layouts).
* **Microdemonstrations**: Includes small-scale demonstrations of specific strategies and techniques employed in more complex visualizations. Examples include animating the movement of a circle along a path and drawing text along a path (in both SVG and Canvas).
* **Other Resources**: Includes other code-based resources for web-based data visualization, for example, a Webpack "starter pack" for beginning new modular visualization-based web projects.

The contents of this repository will continue to shift and grow over time with more demonstrations.

# Caveats

The demonstrations in this repository were created over several years and in several different contexts, from 2019 to 2022. As a result, the demonstrations are not completely consistent in terms of the technology they use. Of particular note, these demonstrations use different versions of D3.js over time, from D3 version 5 to D3 version 7. Please make note of these variations when examining and using the demonstrations. **Use at your own risk!**
