# About these demonstrations

This folder contains microdemonstrations of specific techniques and strategies used in more advanced and bespoke forms of web-based data visualization. Each demonstration is provided as a single file containing HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, where necessary.

# Overview of demonstrations

The following demonstrations are included in this folder:

### HTML Canvas Demonstrations
* **canvas-animate-along-path.html**: Animating the movement of a circle along an arbitrary path. Uses HTML Canvas for drawing and D3/JavaScript for data manipulation.
* **canvas-drawing-circles.html**: Automated detection of circles drawn on the screen; when you click and drag to draw a freeform circle, the freeform sketch is turned into its correlating perfect circle. Uses HTML Canvas for drawing and D3/JavaScript for data manipulation.
* **canvas-gradient-along-path.html**: Drawing a color gradient along an arbitrary path. Uses HTML Canvas for drawing and D3/JavaScript for data manipulation.
* **canvas-pushing-bubbles.html**: Mouse-based interaction that pushes a circle across the screen. Uses HTML Canvas for drawing and D3/JavaScript for data manipulation.
* **canvas-random-ribbons.html**: Drawing ribbon shapes along an arbitrary path. Uses HTML Canvas for drawing and D3/JavaScript for data manipulation.
* **canvas-scroll-interpolate-animation.html**: Animation of a rectangle along an arbitrary path, controlled by/connected to scrolling up and down the screen. Uses HTML Canvas for drawing and D3 for data manipulation.
* **canvas-text-along-path.html**: Drawing arbitrary text along an arbitrary path, drawn in HTML Canvas.

### SVG Demonstrations
* **svg-force-layout.html**: Simple example of a force layout using fictional zoo animal social network data, drawn in SVG.
* **svg-force-layout-with-tooltip.html**: Simple example of a force layout using fictional zoo animal social network data and a mouse-based tooltip, drawn in SVG.
* **svg-text-along-path.html**: Drawing arbitrary text along an arbitrary path, drawn in SVG.
